WP Cookie Banner allows you to display and customise a subtle banner on your website in order to comply with the EU Cookie Law.

== Description ==

WP Cookie Banner is a free WordPress plugin that provides simple 'Implied Consent' compliance with the [EU Cookie Law](http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies). Full customisation and styling for the banner is available through the dedicated Settings page within the Admin Dashboard.

Our initial release of the plugin also includes a helpful 'Testing/Development Mode' that keeps the banner in place on the front-end so that it can be styled and tested easily. Full list of features and settings available:

* Ready to use banner design that's both responsive and retina compatible.
* Testing/Development mode for convenient testing and styling.
* Set the number of days before the banner is shown again to the same user.
* Set how many seconds the banner should be displayed for, before fading out.
* Dynamically select and link your banner to an existing CMS page that elaborates on Privacy and Cookies.
* Customise the short message displayed within the Cookie Banner.
* Modify and choose to migrate the banner's default CSS onto your own stylesheet.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this banner comply with the ICO's regulations? =

Whilst the [guidelines from the ICO](http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies) are still vauge, the ICO do permit the use of 'Implied Consent' banners. Whilst some big names have opted for 'Explicit Consent' banners, others such as the BBC have used the Impied technique which has been adopted for this plugin.

= What is the common reason why the banner might not be loading? =

Because the WP Cookie Banner relies on jQuery, it may fail to load if you have JavaScript or jQuery errors on your site. Please check your the Console Panel in browsers like Google Chrome to debug any JavaScript/jQuery problems or conflicts that may be occuring.
