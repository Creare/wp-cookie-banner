WP Cookie Banner allows you to display and customise a subtle banner on your website to comply with the EU Cookie Law.

== Description ==

WP Cookie Banner is a free WordPress plugin that provides simple 'Implied Consent' compliance with the [EU Cookie Law](http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies). Full customisation and styling for the banner is available through the dedicated Settings Page within the Admin Dashboard.

Our initial release of the plugin also includes a helpful 'Testing/Development Mode' that keeps the banner in place on the front-end so that it can be styled and tested easily. Full list of features and settings available:

* Testing/Development mode for easier testing and styling.
* Cookie Duration - set how many days before the banner is shown again to the user.
* Banner Presentation Time - set how many seconds the banner should be displayed for, before fading out.
* Privacy Page Link - dynamically link your banner through to a CMS page intended to elaborate on Privacy and Cookies.
* Banner Message - customise the warning message within the displayed Cookie Banner.
* Banner Styling - Customise or migrate the banner's CSS onto your own stylesheet.

You can follow and contribute to [WP Cookie Banner on GitHub](https://github.com/Creare/wp-cookie-banner) where the latest version can be found.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this banner comply with the ICO's regulations? =

Whilst the [guidelines from the ICO](http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies) are still vauge, the ICO do permit the use of 'Implied Consent' banners. Whilst some big names have opted for 'Explicit Consent' banners, others such as the BBC have used the Impied technique which has been adopted for this plugin.
